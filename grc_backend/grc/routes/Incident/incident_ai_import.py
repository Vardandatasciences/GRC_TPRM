    prompt = f"""You are a GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) incident analyst. Analyze the following document and extract ALL incidents mentioned.

DOCUMENT TO ANALYZE:
\"\"\"{text[:8000]}\"\"\"

EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:

1. IDENTIFY ALL INCIDENTS in the document (usually 1, sometimes multiple)

2. FOR EACH INCIDENT, extract these fields:
   - IncidentTitle: Clear title (max 255 chars)
   - Description: Comprehensive description (3-5 sentences)
   - Mitigation: JSON array of mitigation steps [{{"step": "...", "status": "...", "responsible": "...", "deadline": "YYYY-MM-DD"}}]
   - Origin: EXACTLY ONE OF: {', '.join(ORIGIN_CHOICES)}
   - Comments: Additional context (2-3 sentences)
   - RiskCategory: ONE OF: {', '.join(RISK_CATEGORY_HINTS)}
   - IncidentCategory: ONE OF: {', '.join(INCIDENT_CATEGORY_HINTS)}
   - RiskPriority: EXACTLY ONE OF: {', '.join(PRIORITY_CHOICES)}
   - Attachments: Semicolon-separated file names (or empty string)
   - Status: EXACTLY ONE OF: {', '.join(STATUS_CHOICES)}
   - RepeatedNot: boolean (true/false)
   - CostOfIncident: String like "$50,000" or "Not assessed"
   - ReopenedNot: boolean (true/false)
   - RejectionSource: {', '.join(REJECTION_SOURCE_CHOICES)} or null
   - AffectedBusinessUnit: Specific business units affected
   - SystemsAssetsInvolved: Systems/applications involved
   - GeographicLocation: Physical/logical location
   - Criticality: EXACTLY ONE OF: {', '.join(CRITICALITY_CHOICES)}
   - InitialImpactAssessment: Initial assessment (3-4 sentences)
   - InternalContacts: Internal personnel involved
   - ExternalPartiesInvolved: External organizations (or empty string)
   - RegulatoryBodies: Regulatory authorities (or empty string)
   - RelevantPoliciesProceduresViolated: Policies violated
   - ControlFailures: Security control failures (2-3 sentences)
   - LessonsLearned: Key learnings (2-4 sentences)
   - IncidentClassification: Classification code
   - PossibleDamage: Potential damages (2-3 sentences)
   - IncidentFormDetails: JSON object with keys: reported_by, detection_method, response_time_minutes, escalation_level, containment_status, root_cause_category, affected_records_count, recovery_time_objective

3. ADD METADATA for each field:
   - source: "EXTRACTED" (if explicitly in document) or "AI_GENERATED" (if inferred)
   - confidence: 0.0-1.0
   - rationale: Brief explanation

4. OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with an "incidents" key containing an array:
{{
  "incidents": [
    {{
      "IncidentTitle": "...",
      "Description": "...",
      ... (all fields above) ...,
      "_meta": {{
        "per_field": {{
          "IncidentTitle": {{"source": "EXTRACTED", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "Found in document header"}},
          "Description": {{"source": "AI_GENERATED", "confidence": 0.7, "rationale": "Inferred from context"}}
        }}
      }}
    }}
  ]
}}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations
- Use double quotes for all strings
- Boolean values must be true/false (lowercase)
- No trailing commas
- Ensure all choice fields match EXACTLY the allowed values
- If a field cannot be determined, use reasonable defaults or empty strings
- For JSON fields (Mitigation, IncidentFormDetails), ensure proper nested structure
